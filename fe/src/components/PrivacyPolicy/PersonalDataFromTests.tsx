        When recruiting for certain positions, you may be invited to take a
        test. We will always consider whether it is relevant that you take such
        test in relation to the relevant position. The purpose of the test is to
        evaluate your qualifications as a potential employee and to consider
        whether your profile suits our business and the specific position. The
        test will never stand alone but will be part of the general basis for
        selecting the right person for the position.
