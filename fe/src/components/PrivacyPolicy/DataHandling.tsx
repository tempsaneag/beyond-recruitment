        As a recruitment business and recruitment agency, we introduce
        candidates to clients for permanent employment, temporary worker
        placements or independent professional contracts. The exchange of
        personal data of our candidates and our client contacts is a
        fundamental, essential part of this process. In order to support our
        candidates' career aspirations and our clients' resourcing needs we
        require a database of candidate and client personal data containing
        historical information as well as current resourcing requirements.

      <p className='text-lg text-gray-700'>
        To maintain, expand and develop our business, we need to record the
        personal data of prospective candidates and client contacts. Due to the
        nature of our business, we will never store your personal data for a
        period longer than five (5) years without contacting you in this time to
        receive explicit consent. To deliver our ancillary services we need to
        contact candidates on a regular basis, through various routes such as
        email, phone, job alerts and other relevant notifications.
